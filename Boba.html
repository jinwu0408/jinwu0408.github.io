        <p>
          The dispenser is a fully
          autonomous system that will take a customer/user’s choice of bubble
          tea from various options (i.e. Milk Tea, Strawberry Milk Tea, etc.),
          and dispense the drink into an appropriate-sized cup. The
          product will be constructed from durable materials that have been
          laser cut to ensure proper fitting. The bubble tea will be dispensed
          from a built-in reservoir, along with the tapioca balls, through a
          system of pumps connected via food-grade silicone tubes. A Raspberry
          Pi will be used as the microcontroller controlling the machine’s pumps
          and on-board electronics, such as the OLED display. The Pi will also
          execute a Python script to communicate with the various peripherals
          to properly dispense the user’s chosen drink.

        <h1>Motivation</h1>
        <p>This project aims to provide bubble tea store owners an alternative
          to their manual labor force in a rapidly expanding market. As of
          2016, the global bubble tea market was valued at $1.9M and is
          projected to reach $3.2M by 2023 (Allied Market Research). The
          increasing demand for bubble tea will consequently cause a rise in
          the demand for workers in the tea industry, which may cause a
          shortage in the labor force. To relieve the strain on the workers,
          as well as business owners hiring these workers, this project will
          automate the process of serving bubble tea to customers.

        <h1>Build Steps</h1>
        <h2>Building the Frame</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>From a 13 inch block of 0.75”x 1.5” common wood, saw the
            following portions:<ul>
              <li>4 x 16” blocks</li>
              <li>6 x 7.5” blocks</li>
              <li>4 x 9” blocks</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Screw 2 of the 16” blocks with 2 of the 7.5” blocks to make the
            sides of the dispenser frame.(Figure 5.1)
            <ul>
              <li>Repeat this process one more time to have two frame pieces
                for the dispenser.</li>
              <li>It is helpful to drill plot holes before screwing in wood
                screws to prevent the wood from cracking.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Use four 9” blocks to connect the two frame pieces together from
            the top and bottom.
          </li>
          <li> Connect two more 7.5” blocks for the drink platform (Figure 5.1).
            <ul>
              <li>Measure 3” from the bottom of the frame and screw
                the 7.5” blocks at the mark.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        </div>
        <h2>Mounting and Wiring Electronics</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Refer to the wiring schematic for all steps in this section
            (Figure 8).
          </li>
          <li>
            After deciding where each electronic component will be placed, begin
            by connecting the 12 volt power supply to Power Display Board (PDB).
            <ul>
              <li>You will be connecting a wire (red) that signifies a positive
                power connection to P1, and another wire (black) that signifies
                a GND connection to P2 (Figure 5.2).
              </li>
              <li>
                Make sure to use the Sortie positive and negative(GND) inputs
                of the power supply (Figure 6).
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <div class="image">
            <img src="img/Boba_fig6.jpg" alt="ABG">
            <figcaption>Fig.6 Power Supply---Transformer</figcaption>
          </div>
          <li>
            After successfully connecting the power supply to PDB, you will then
            connect the pumps to the PDB. First connect two wires to PDB’s P1
            input, which will be for each pump’s positive ended pin.
            <ul>
              <li>
                Two GND wires will then be connected to two channels of the 8
                channel relay(check schematic for respective pin allocations).
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            The pumps will need soldering for the GND and positive wire, as well
            as the 1N4007 diode. This diode will be soldered between the two
            wires for each pump, making sure the grey line of the diodes are
            facing the positive side of the pumps.
          </li>
          <li>
            Proceed by connecting the 8 channel relay to Raspberry PI 3
            (or zero). Pin wiring can be seen on electronic schematic.
          </li>

            <figcaption>Fig.7 Eight channel relay</figcaption>
          </div>
          <li>
            Next, the 5V regulator will be connected from power supply to
            Raspberry Pi and 8 channel relay (Figure 7). The positive and
            GND inputs of 5V regulator will be connected to the respective
            pins of the PDB. The positive and GND outputs will then be connected
            to 8 channel relay and Raspberry (Figure 8).
            <ul>
              <li>
                In order to successfully connect the 5V regulator, soldering must
                be done for each input and output with their respective wiring.
                Secondly, an additional wire must be soldered to the positive
                output of 5V regulator to make a second connection to Raspberry Pi,
                also known as a SPLICE.
              </li>
            </ul>

          </div>
          <li>
            Next, check schematic for final pin wirings of OLED screen and buttons.
          </li>
          <li>
            Finally, powering the system will require a computer cable. This
            cable will be cut to where the three inner wires are able to be
            inserted into the power supply inputs. Please check resources for
            color coordination to successfully power on the electronic system.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Software</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Create the Python scripts (https://github.com/jinwu0408/Automated-Boba-Gadget)
          </li>
          <li>
            Configure inputs and outputs according to what pins used on the
            Raspberry Pi (Bartender.py -> function initial)
          </li>
          <li>
            Make a menu of all the drinks with their ingredients included
            (drinks.py)
          </li>
          <li>
            Create a script that implements the buttons and pumps (Bartender.py)
          </li>
          <li>
            Pressing one button cycles through the menu so that there is only
            one drink displayed at a time (function next_item)
          </li>
          <li>
            Pressing the other button enables the pumps and motor for the boba,
            dispensing it into the drink (function dispense)
          </li>
          <li>
            Create a script that updates the OLED display screen with the current
            menu item (updateDisplay)
          </li>
          <li>
            Add a countdown timer on the OLED to display how much time before
            the drink is finished dispensing
          </li>
          <li>
            Test and debug
          </li>
          <li>
